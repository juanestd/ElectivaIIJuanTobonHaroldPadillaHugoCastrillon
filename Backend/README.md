## Description
Clone de X is an application that simulates the functionality of a social network, allowing users to register, log in, post tweets, follow other users, and manage their profile. The project has been designed using **Clean Architecture**, promoting the separation of responsibilities and maintainability of the code. We have implemented several design patterns, including the **Mapper pattern**, **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), **Dependency Injection**, **Interface Segregation**, and **Single Responsibility**.

Additionally, we have implemented **JWT authentication** to secure access to the API's protected routes. The API documentation is created using **Swagger**, allowing developers and users to easily view and test the endpoints. To ensure code quality, **unit tests** have been conducted using **Jest** and **Supertest**. **Bcrypt** is also used for **password encryption**, ensuring the security of user data.
